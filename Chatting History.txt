I'm looking for a skilled developer to modify my EA to be used in RANGE BREAK 100 AND 200, the EA Must close every orders when spike occurs.
Currently it replaces orders after hitting SL so now i want it to be made for range breaks 100 and 200 it should automatically close every orders when spike occurs.
For example if spike occurs while there was a buy position opened at -2 or +2 it should close at that position.
